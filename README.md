Simulate orbits of stars interacting due to gravity

Code calculates pairwise forces according to Newton's Law of Gravity

Solve an Inverse Problem (with automatic differentiation!):
Given a distribution of masses, find initial velocities
that evolve the distribution into a heart-shaped configuration.

```
python nbody.py
```

The inititial condition that led to the heart-shape:
